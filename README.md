## 💸 Money talk: disclosure and commitment

While poko is [open source](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/) and free for personal use, its use is currently subject to a one-time fee for commercial or non-personal projects.

The open source movement is awesome and an example for so many disciplines and industries. We want to be part of it!  
At the same time, there is a tricky balance to be found between simply giving away the most precious thing we have (our time) for what we believe in and making a project viable on the long run. Many open source maintainers still struggle to find the time and ressources to work on their projects, as awesome as they are.

We hope that, with time, we will find that perfect balance. In the meantime, here are a few principles and commitments we try to work by:

- Be transparent about our financial situation and commitments
- Follow our mission and values above profit
- Trust our community to support the project in the best way they can
- Transfer part of our profit to the main open source projects we rely on
