# Our commitment

The web was meant to be open, accessible, and empowering. We built poko to bring that vision back.

Most website builders today lock you into expensive subscriptions, proprietary systems, or endless maintenance headaches. We wanted to create something different—a path to digital independence that doesn't ask you to sacrifice quality, creativity, or your values.

## Built for the planet

Every poko website emits around 90% less CO² than a typical WordPress or Wix site, and we're still improving. This isn't just about checking a sustainability box—lightweight, efficient code means your site loads faster, feels smoother, and works better for everyone who visits it.

We run on green hosting powered by renewable energy. Your content lives in simple, readable files instead of bloated databases. Everything is designed to do more with less.

## Actually free (seriously)

Hosting is free on modern static platforms, with generous allowances. No subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, no surprise fees. Your only recurring cost will likely be your domain name—around 15€ a year.

The infrastructure gets set up in your name. Your content stays in files you can read and edit. If you ever want to leave, you take everything with you. That's the kind of freedom we believe the web should offer.

## Surprisingly simple

You get a no-code CMS to manage your content without touching a line of code. But nothing is hidden. Your content is stored in Markdown and YAML files that any human can read and understand. No database, no complex architecture, no technical mysteries.

Updates are optional. Maintenance is optional. There's no security risk if you skip them—the static architecture simply doesn't give hackers any way in. Set up decent passwords and 2FA for your accounts, and you're good to go.

We built poko on proven open source projects like Eleventy and Sveltia CMS, connected to free, replaceable services like GitHub and Cloudflare Pages. This makes the whole thing remarkably resilient. You're not betting on a single vendor or a fragile custom stack.

## Room to grow

The simple interface handles most needs, but power users can dig into the code whenever they want. Customize layouts, extend the CMS with custom data types, reshape the whole site. The architecture supports both casual editing and deep technical work without the two getting in each other's way.

## What drives us

We care about transparency, ecology, and freedom. We want to make beautiful, accessible, high-performing websites the default, not the exception. And we want to do it in a way that respects your independence, your budget, and the planet.

The web doesn't have to be complicated, expensive, or extractive. We're here to prove that.
